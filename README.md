# Project1


 Group 3 which consists of Rachel, Jee, Joel, and Ray have designed an application to which allows users to look up food restaurants near them or in any state or city of their choosing. This app, however, does not only look up restaurants that have any type of food. This app was designed to help people who are vegan, or just starting out converting to veganism find restaurants that offer vegan options. Whether they are looking for a quick bite to eat or having lunch with friends. This app was designed to help make finding vegan options easier and more precise.
